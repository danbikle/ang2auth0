Hello World.

I built this repo after I studied this page:

https://github.com/auth0/angular2-authentication-sample/blob/master/Readme.md

To get started you should get a laptop which runs MacOS/X or Ubunutu 14.04.3.

I got a laptop which runs Ubuntu.

Then I ran some shell commands:
```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/danbikle/ang2auth0
cd ~/ang2auth0/
ls -l
```
